-- This is a module where we can define an "underlay" below the game canvas. This can be used for many things.
-- One example would be to simulate pokemon nes roms' "frame" that encompassed the functional screen.
-- Note that this need not be static, but to animate it, it would be wise to write one's own function for it.
